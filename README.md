Hey, future whoever you are.

hate yourself.                                                                                          
 
but we have come to a conclusion and have accepted the fact that this life is just a test.

and only strong people can succceed

i get that i will never be like the greats but i can become my best self, which will benefit me more compared to the hate mindset.

so hate yourself and keep growing
